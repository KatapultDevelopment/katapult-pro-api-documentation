# Responses

## Success

For individual resources, the data field contains the resource:
```js
type EntityResponse = {
  status: "success",
  data: {
    id: string, // Id of the resource
    // Other resource fields
  },
  meta: {
    token_count: number, // Tokens remaining after the request
    last_refill_time: number, // Epoch time of the last token refill
  }
}
```

For lists of resources, the data field contains an array of resources:
```ts
type ListResponse = {
  status: "success",
  data: [
    {
      id: string, // Id of the list item
      // Other resource fields
    },
    // More resources
  ],
  meta: {
    token_count: number, // Tokens remaining after the request
    last_refill_time: number, // Epoch time of the last token refill
  }
}
```

## Error
```ts
type ErrorResponse = {
  status: "error",
  message: string, // Error message
  type: string, // Type of error in human-readable format (e.g. "not_found")
  meta: {
    token_count: number, // Tokens remaining after the request
    last_refill_time: number, // Epoch time of the last token refill
  }
}
```

# Other API Concepts

## Working with Attributes

### Nodes, Connections, and Sections

Nodes, connections, and sections all have attributes, and their attributes are stored as an "entity attribute list": a JSON object mapping attribute names to values on an entity. The structure of the object is as follows:
```ts
type EntityAttributeList = {
  [attribute_name: string]: {
    [instance_id: string]: any // Value of this attribute instance
  }
}
```

That is, for each attribute in an attribute list, there may be multiple "values" (stored under an `instance_id`). The following is an example of a node attribute list:
```json
{
  "node_type": {
    "-OPWRGCw7wC7DA3Lt6SX": "pole"
  },
  "scid": {
    "-OPWRQOwUdDU4X4f_-8u": "001"
  },
  "note": {
    "-OPWRVKh0JHKTnZrY8O5": "This is a note",
    "-OPWRVYCKdxh34WoQXAv": "This is another note"
  }
}
```

The one-to-many relationship between attribute names and values makes working with entity attribute lists a bit more complex. As a result, Katapult recommends only setting one value per attribute when possible. The API also provides some convenience methods for working with attributes.

To **add** attributes to an entity list without specifying instance ids, you can use the `add_attributes` field on POST requests. This field is a flat map of attribute names to values, and the API will automatically create instance ids for each value. 

For example, the following request:
```json
{
  "add_attributes": {
    "node_type": "pole",
    "scid": "001"
  }
}
```
will create new attribute instances for `node_type` and `scid` with the values "pole" and "001", respectively. The API will automatically generate instance ids for these attributes.

To **remove** attributes from an entity list without specifying instance ids, you can use the `remove_attributes` field on POST requests. This field is a list of attribute names to remove, and the API will remove all instances of those attributes from the entity.
For example, the following request:
```json
{
  "remove_attributes": ["node_type", "scid"]
}
```
will remove _all_ instances of the `node_type` and `scid` attributes from the entity.

If you need to **update** an attribute value, you must use the `attributes` field on POST requests. This field is a partial entity attribute list with a number of behaviors:
- Any attributes not specified in the request will not be modified.
- If an attribute instance id is specified, the value will be updated for that instance id.
- Setting either the attribute name or instance id to `null` will remove that attribute or instance id from the entity, respectively.

For example, this request:
```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "node_type": {
      "-OPWRGCw7wC7DA3Lt6SX": "reference"
    },
    "scid": null,
    "note": {
      "-OPWRVYCKdxh34WoQXAv": null
    }
  }
}
```
would do the following:
- Update the `node_type` attribute instance (id = `-OPWRGCw7wC7DA3Lt6SX`) to "reference".
- Remove the `scid` attribute from the entity (if there were more than one instance, all instances would be removed).
- Remove the `note` attribute instance (id = `-OPWRVYCKdxh34WoQXAv`) from the entity.

Note that to update specific attribute instances, you must have the instance id.

The `remove_attributes`, `attributes`, and `add_attributes` fields can be used together in a single request, and they are applied in that order.

### Jobs

Jobs have attributes (under the `metadata` field) that are stored as a flat map; job attributes may not have more than one value. The structure of the object is as follows:
```ts
type JobMetadata = {
  [attribute_name: string]: any // Value of this attribute
}
```

To add, update, or remove attributes from a job, you can use the `metadata` field on POST requests. This request:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "description": "A description of the job",
    "contact_number": null
  }
}
```
would do the following:
- Add (or update) the `description` attribute to "A description of the job".
- Remove the `contact_number` attribute from the job.

### Photo Elements and Traces

Photo elements and traces have their attributes stored as a flat map too and can be updated in the same way as job attributes. However, photo element and trace attributes are not stored under a `metadata` or `attributes` field; instead, they are stored directly on the element or trace object. To access an attribute you've set on either a photo element or a trace, read the attribute name property directly from the root of the object.

## Resource ID Requirements

It is possible to create resources with user-defined IDs through the POST update endpoints. However, there are some requirements for ids that you should be aware of:
- All ids must be alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and may contain dashes (-) and underscores (_).
- All ids must be between 20 and 256 characters long.
- All ids must be unique within the job.

Attribute instance ids are not subject to the length or uniqueness requirements, but they must still be alphanumeric and may contain dashes and underscores.

# Rate Limits

All REST APIs employ rate limits to ensure fair use and prevent abuse. Version 3 of Katapult Pro's API uses two different rate limiting strategies to help manage the volume of requests being processed. If you send too many requests at one time, you may receive an error response with a status code of `429`.

## General Rate Limit

Each API key is subject to a general rate limit of **1 call per 50 milliseconds**. This limit prevents sudden bursts of calls from overloading connected APIs.

## Token System

The token system works by assigning a token cost to each call. Generally, calls with more database transactions will have a higher token cost.

Each individual API key has its own "bucket" of tokens. When a call is made, the cost of the call is deducted from the caller's token bucket count. Once the token bucket is depleted, further calls will be blocked until the bucket is refilled. 

The token bucket systems operates under the following set of parameters: 
- The default token bucket allotment is **10000 tokens**.
  - Default token allotment is subject to change.
- All token buckets are refilled **every minute**.
- Successful calls deduct the cost of the call from the token bucket.
- Blocked calls will error and return a status code of `429`.
- All API responses (success and error) include a `meta` object that contains information about the API key's token bucket state, including `token_count` (the number of tokens remaining) and `last_refill_time` (the last time that the bucket was refilled)
  - The bucket will be refilled when 60 seconds have elapsed since the `last_refill_time`. 

Listed below are the current costs of our API calls:
- **POST** and **DELETE** calls: 10 tokens each
- **GET** calls: 1 token each
