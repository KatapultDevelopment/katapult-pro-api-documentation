# Photos

Photo records, uploads, signed URLs, and associations.

The photo `GET` endpoints return photo **records** (metadata), not image bytes.
To download the image, call [`GET /jobs/{job_id}/photos/{photo_id}/url`](#get-a-photo-download-url)
for a signed URL (valid for 7 days). Uploads must be `image/jpeg`.

The `associate` endpoint has codependent body fields (target a node **or** a
section; accepted `association_value`s) — see
[Complex & codependent parameters](../concepts/complex-parameters.md#associating-a-photo-node-vs-section-vs-unassociate).
